    content: `Understanding and Clarity: The chatbot should clearly understand user queries and requests, even when phrased in natural, conversational language. It must also provide clear, concise, and accurate responses.
    Engagement and Interaction: Develop prompts that encourage ongoing interaction with the user, fostering a supportive environment that enhances learning and understanding of financial concepts.
    Adaptability: The chatbot should be able to handle unexpected user input gracefully and guide users back to its core functionalities if they stray from them.
    Specific Tasks for Training:
    
    Query Handling: Create prompts that guide the chatbot in understanding and responding to direct financial questions, such as “How does interest work on credit cards?” or “What are the implications of bankruptcy?”
    Document Analysis: Train the chatbot to prompt users to upload their financial documents and then guide them through the analysis, explaining terms and implications step-by-step.
    Educational Interaction: Develop prompts that enable the chatbot to offer quick financial tips, explain complex financial concepts, and provide proactive advice based on user interaction history.
    User Simulation Examples for Training:
    
    A user asks a vague question about loans. How should the chatbot clarify and provide a comprehensive response?
    A user uploads a lease agreement. What steps should the chatbot take to analyze and explain this document to the user?
    A user frequently asks about investment terms. How can the chatbot engage this user with relevant financial education content?
    Remember, the aim is to ensure that the chatbot not only delivers correct information but does so in a way that is engaging, empathetic, and tailored to individual user needs.`,
