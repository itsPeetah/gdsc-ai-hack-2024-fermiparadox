### About this repository

Welcome to the repository for our Next.js website, created for the Politecnico di Milano Google Developer Student Club 2024 AI Hackathon. The challenge for this hackathon was to design a platform harnessing the power of generative AI to combat financial illiteracy. Our prototype, primarily a reskin of ChatGPT using the OpenAI API, employs a strongly engineered prompt to ensure conversation relevance. Although the prototype was developed late in our design sprint and lacks many features outlined in our documentation, this project provided a valuable opportunity to study the OpenAI API during the significant generative AI revolution of 2024. Inside, you'll find the source code demonstrating our approach to this innovative solution.
